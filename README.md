# etf_analysis

## background
In recent years, finance has had an explosion in passive investing. Passive investing means that you invest in a basket of assets that’s called an exchange-traded fund (ETF). This way, you don’t spend time researching individual stocks or companies or take the risk of investing in a single stock. ETFs offer more diversification.
In this Challenge assignment, you’ll build a financial database and web application by using SQL, Python, and the Voilà library to analyze the performance of a hypothetical fintech ETF.

This is a Jupyter notebook that contains the following:
An analysis of the ETF data that a SQL database stores
Professionally styled and formatted interactive visualizations
A screenshot or video of the web application that you created by deploying your Jupyter notebook via the Voilà library
